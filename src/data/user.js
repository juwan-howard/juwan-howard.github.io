		biography: [
			"My journey in filmmaking has been shaped by formal education and hands-on experience — from earning my BA in Film and Media Studies at UC Berkeley to my current pursuit of an MFA in Narrative Directing at UCLA. This academic foundation has deepened my understanding of cinema's unique power to transcend entertainment and serve as a critical lens through which we examine culture, identity, and society.",
			"Through roles spanning direction, production, and creative development, I've cultivated adaptability and collaborative leadership while developing a profound respect for diverse perspectives. These experiences have fostered gratitude for my position within the filmmaking community and a responsibility to approach storytelling with intention and cultural awareness.",
			"I approach each project with a commitment to creating spaces where artistic excellence and cultural authenticity can coexist. By centering both technical craft and human connection, I strive to develop narratives that resonate beyond the screen — stories that honor community voices while pushing creative boundaries. My work is guided by the belief that the most compelling cinema emerges when we celebrate both artistic innovation and cultural identity."
