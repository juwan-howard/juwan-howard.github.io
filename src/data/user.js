		biography: [
			"I am a film student at UCLA's School of Theater, Film and Television, where I've been developing my skills as a cinematographer and visual storyteller. My passion for film began when I first picked up a camera at the age of 15, capturing the world around me and learning how to tell stories through images.",
			"Throughout my academic journey, I've had the opportunity to work on various short films, documentaries, and experimental projects that have allowed me to explore different visual styles and techniques. I'm particularly drawn to naturalistic lighting and creating atmospheric moods that enhance narrative elements.",
			"My approach to cinematography focuses on creating authentic visual experiences that serve the story while pushing creative boundaries. I believe that every frame should contribute to the emotional impact of a film, and I strive to create images that resonate with audiences."
